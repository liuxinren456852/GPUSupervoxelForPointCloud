## Runtime Environment 
```
The project requires: OpenGL 4.2 or later; 

We provide GLFW in "includes" and "lib" dirs. 
Create "build" dir and use cmake to build the project. Note that the paths of shaders should be correct.

```

## Parameters 
```
Specify the paths of position and normal of the point cloud. 

We provide an example point cloud in the "example" dir. We pre-compute the normals of the points. 

The program generates supervoxel segmentation results in txt file, including labels and pseudo-color result. 
You can specify the "save_type" of the txt result. Please use software "CloudCompare" to see the pseudo-color result. 


You can download the point cloud datasets from following websites:
